# Redux Basic Examples

The purpose of this repo is to remind myself (and others maybe) how to use Redux after long periods of not touching it. 

## How to use the examples

Examples are kept in the `examples` folder. Find the examples you want and just run it with the `node` command. E.g.

    node ./examples/01-basic-example.js
